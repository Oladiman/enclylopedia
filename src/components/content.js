export const firstContent = `The fauna of Africa, in its broader sense, is all the animals living in
Africa and its surrounding seas and islands. The more characteristic
African fauna is found in the Afrotropical realm.[1] Lying almost
entirely within the tropics, and equally to north and south of the
equator creates favourable conditions for rich wildlife. Africa is home
to many of the world's most famous fauna in human culture such as lions‚
rhinos‚ cheetahs‚ giraffes‚ antelope, hippos, leopards, zebras‚ and
African elephants among many others.`


export const SecondContent = `There are large gaps in human knowledge about African invertebrates.
East Africa has a rich coral fauna[12] with about 400 known species.
More than 400 species of Echinoderms and 500 species of Bryozoa live
there too,[13] as well as one Cubozoan species (Carybdea alata). Of
Nematodes, the Onchocerca volvulus, Necator americanus, Wuchereria
bancrofti and Dracunculus medinensis are human parasites. Some of
important plant-parasitic nematodes of crops include Meloidogyne,
Pratylenchus, Hirschmanniella, Radopholus, Scutellonema and
Helicotylenchus.[14][15][16][17] Of the few Onychophorans,
Peripatopsis and Opisthopatus live in Africa.[18] Greatest diversity
of freshwater mollusks is found in East African lakes. Of marine
snails, less diversity is present in Atlantic coast, more in tropical
Western Indian Ocean region (over 3000 species of gastropods with 81
endemic species).[19][20] Cowry shells have been used as a money by
native Africans. The land snail fauna is especially rich in
Afromontane regions, and there are some endemic families in Africa
(e.g. Achatinidae, Chlamydephoridae) but other tropical families are
common too (Charopidae, Streptaxidae, Cyclophoridae, Subulinidae,
Rhytididae). 156 tardigrade species have been found,[21][22] and about
8000 species of arachnids. The African millipede Archispirostreptus
gigas is one of the largest in the world. 20 genera of freshwater
crabs are present.[23] The soil animal communities tropical Africa are
poorly known. A few ecological studies have been undertaken on
macrofauna, mainly in West Africa.[24] Earthworms are being
extensively studied in West and South Africa.[25][26]`
